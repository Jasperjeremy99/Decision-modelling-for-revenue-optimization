# Revenue-Optimization-Decision-Model

This repository contains a decision-making model primarily implemented in Microsoft Excel, designed to optimize revenue for "Hotel Paradise." The project focuses on strategic booking management, dynamic pricing, and risk assessment to maximize daily profits and occupancy rates, particularly during high seasons.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive decision framework for hotel stakeholders to efficiently manage operations during periods of high demand. By analyzing various factors such as reservations, pricing strategies, and potential risks, the model aims to optimize revenue generation and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Files Overview

* **`revenue_optimization_presentation.pptx`**: This PowerPoint presentation offers a detailed overview of the project, including:
    * Introduction to the business problem for Hotel Paradise.
    * Definition of project objectives and key concepts related to booking management, risk assessment, and demand fluctuation.
    * An in-depth explanation of the decision model's structure, including its key outputs, management decision variables, stochastic variables, fixed variables, and calculated variables.
    * Summary of key findings from the model's analysis, such as projected daily profits across different seasons and optimal room rates.
    * Actionable recommendations for stakeholders to maximize revenue and occupancy, derived directly from the model's insights.

* **`revenue_optimization_workfile.xlsx`**: This Excel workfile serves as the core implementation of the decision model. It contains:
    * The underlying data for the hotel's operations.
    * Calculations and formulas that drive the revenue optimization model.
    * Various scenarios exploring different room rates, reservation levels, cancellation impacts, and walk-in guest effects.
    * Simulated data and output summaries that demonstrate the model's predictions and risk profiling.
    * **Note:** To fully interact with the model, formulas, and scenarios, this file requires Microsoft Excel.

## Dataset

The project utilizes data embedded within the `revenue_optimization_workfile.xlsx` file. This includes historical operational data, assumptions for stochastic variables (e.g., daily reservations, cancellations, walk-ins), and the results of various simulation runs and scenario analyses.

## Technologies Used

* Microsoft Excel (for model development, data management, and scenario analysis).
* Microsoft PowerPoint (for project presentation).
* Decision Modeling and Optimization Principles.
